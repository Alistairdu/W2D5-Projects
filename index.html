The quality of mercy is not strained;<br> 
It droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven<br> 
Upon the place beneath. It is twice blest;<br> 
It blesseth him that gives and him that takes:<br> 
'T is mightiest in the mightiest; it becomes<br> 
The throned monarch better than his crown:<br> 
His sceptre shows the force of temporal power,<br> 
The attribute to awe and majesty,<br> 
Wherein doth sit the dread and fear of kings;<br> 
But mercy is above this sceptred sway;<br> 
It is enthron√®d in the hearts of kings,<br> 
It is an attribute to God himself;<br> 
And earthly power doth then show likest God's<br> 
When mercy seasons justice. Therefore, Jew,<br> 
Though justice be thy plea, consider this,<br> 
That, in the course of justice, none of us<br> 
Should see salvation: we do pray for mercy;<br> 
And that same prayer doth teach us all to render<br> 
The deeds of mercy. I have spoke thus much<br> 
To mitigate the justice of thy plea;<br> 
Which if thou follow, this strict court of Venice<br> 
Must needs give sentence 'gainst the merchant there.<br> 
  <br>
